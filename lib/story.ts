export const story = `In the wake of the legendary Cicada 3301, a new cryptographic puzzle emerged in 2025 - Solcada.

Unlike its predecessor, Solcada was born on the Solana blockchain, created by a collective of cryptographers, mathematicians, and blockchain developers who sought to find the brightest minds in the decentralized world.

The first clue appeared as a smart contract on the Solana mainnet, containing an encrypted message that could only be deciphered by those who understood both classical cryptography and blockchain technology.

As word spread through the cryptographic community, thousands attempted to solve the initial puzzle. Many failed. Those who succeeded were led deeper into a labyrinth of increasingly complex challenges.

The puzzles tested not just technical knowledge, but creative thinking, persistence, and an understanding of decentralized systems that few possessed.

Some say Solcada was created to recruit for a secret organization developing next-generation cryptographic protocols. Others believe it was designed to identify those capable of discovering vulnerabilities in blockchain systems before they could be exploited.

Whatever the truth, one thing is certain: those who complete the Solcada challenges are forever changed, gaining access to knowledge and communities hidden from the rest of the world.

Now you stand at the threshold. Your wallet is your identity. Your mind is your key.

Are you ready to begin?`

export const levelCompletionStories = {
  1: `LEVEL 1 COMPLETE
====================

Impressive. You've demonstrated a basic understanding of Solana's architecture.

The first firewall has been breached. Your digital footprint has been recorded on the blockchain.

But this is merely the beginning. The real challenges lie ahead.

As you progress, remember: in the world of cryptography, nothing is as it seems.

Proceed to Level 2 when ready.
====================`,

  2: `LEVEL 2 COMPLETE
====================

Your persistence is noteworthy. Few make it this far.

You've now gained access to the second layer of the Solcada network. Your wallet signature has been verified and your progress recorded.

The collective is watching your journey with interest. Your analytical skills suggest potential.

But the final test will require more than knowledge. It will test your intuition, your ability to see patterns where others see chaos.

Prepare yourself for Level 3. The most challenging cryptographic puzzles await.
====================`,

  3: `LEVEL 3 COMPLETE
====================

Extraordinary. You've completed the final level of the Solcada challenge.

Your cryptographic prowess has been verified and permanently recorded on the Solana blockchain.

A smart contract has been deployed to your wallet address containing your reward and further instructions.

The collective has taken notice of your abilities. In the coming days, you may receive additional communications.

Remember: security through obscurity is no security at all.

We will be in touch.
====================`,

====================

Congratulations, [USERNAME].

You have successfully navigated through all three levels of the Solcada 2025 challenge. Your cryptographic prowess and blockchain knowledge have proven exceptional.

Your final score: [POINTS] points ([SOL] SOL)

Few have made it this far. Your wallet address [WALLET] has been recorded in our secure ledger, marking you as one of the elite cryptographic minds of this era.

What happens next is your choice.

Some who reach this point choose to disappear back into the digital ether, taking their newfound knowledge with them.

Others seek to join our ranks.

If you wish to proceed further, a new smart contract has been deployed to your wallet. Within it lies the next clue - one that will lead you deeper into our network.

The choice is yours, [USERNAME].

Remember: Not all puzzles have solutions. Not all solutions lead to answers.

We will be watching.
